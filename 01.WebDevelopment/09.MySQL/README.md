# MySQL and PHP Web Pages

There are 5 web pages contained here, all of which interact with a private table of photos set up in the TMU Computer Science database. The first populates the table with photos and data, the second displays all the information contained using a query that also sorts the data in descending order of date taken. The third page displays only the pictures taken in Ontario, along with their subject and location. The fourth page has an HTML form that the user fills out and submits to query the database and display pictures that satisfy the query. Finally, the last page has a selection of one random image along with the current number of images in the database.
