# A Web Page Utilizing Vanilla JavaScript

There are three problems within this web page that is using vanilla JavaScript, meaning no frameworks were used. The first, a form validator requiring specific criteria for each user input. The second, a count of characters that updates in real time and the third, a list of bookmarks to my favourite websites.
