# PHP Server-Side Scripts

A web page using PHP scripts that shows a message and background relative to the time of day. It also has the ability to generate a multiplication table with dimensions based on two numbers input by the user, appearing on a separate page. Finally, there is a hit counter that uses cookies to track and display the number of hits the page has received.
