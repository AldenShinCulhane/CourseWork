                    <h2>The History of Shenyang</h2>
                    <p>
                        Shenyang has a dense history that dates back more than 2,300 years. It has been a significant city in China's
                        history, once being the capital of the Qing Dynasty before later being moved to Beijing. Its past can be
                        partially explored through breathtaking historical sites like the Shenyang Imperial Palace, the old city
                        walls, and the tombs of Qing Dynasty emperors.

                    <h2>Shenyang's Many Attractions</h2>
                    <p>
                        A notable attraction in Shengyang is the Shenyang Imperial Palace, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site
                        made to resemble Beijing's Forbidden City. Another attraction is the September 18th History Museum, which
                        commemorates the Mukden Incident that led to one of the most destructive WWII conflicts, the Sino-Japanese
                        War. The city's lush parks and the nearby Qipan Mountain are natural attractions within and around Shenyang
                        for tourists and locals to both enjoy.

                    <h2>The Culture in Shenyang</h2>
                    <p>
                        The city's culture consists of a blend of traditional Manchu culture, an ethic group within China, and modern
                        Chinese influences. The Shenyang dialect is a variant of Mandarin and it is widely spoken among the population
                        of the city. Shenyang is known for its vibrant festivals like the Shenyang International Ice and Snow Festival,
                        which shows off the city's cultural richness and character. Shenyang has a population of 7,681,000 as of 2023,
                        making it the 54th largest city in the world at this time.
