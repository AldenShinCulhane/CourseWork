# ASP, CGI/Ruby and CGI/Python Scripts

Contained are three programs, the first of which accepts a query and then uses Classic ASP to generate a page that has a different background colour depending on the values submitted. The second accepts a user created HTML form to display, using either a CGI/Ruby script or a CGI/Python script of the user's choice. The final page uses React for its framework, with instructions explaining how the framework was installed and how the page was built.
