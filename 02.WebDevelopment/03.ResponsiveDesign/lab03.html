                    Implementing Part A involved pure HTML and CSS, this left me with a much better understanding of how to implement media queries,
                    fluid grids, and viewport settings to create a responsive web page. It took a lot of time to make sure the layout adapted
                    well to various screen sizes. The challenges I encountered included determining the appropriate breakpoints and ensuring the
                    images were responsive. Implementing Part B using the Bootstrap framework created a significantly nicer finished product and
                    was a more intuitive development process for me. The predefined grid system and classes in Bootstrap made it so that I didn't
                    have to manually write and test the responsiveness of the layout, making it a more straightforward and satisfying approach.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    If I were to choose between the two, I would say I preferred the approach in Part B. The Bootstrap framework was easier
                    for me to work with and had more options for me to explore using responsive classes. This is ultimately why I decided to
                    use the Bootstrap framework for this Home Page as well. However, Part A provided me with a better grasp of the underlying
                    principles of responsive design. This is something I still appreciated and it will help facilitate my troubleshooting and
                    custom styling in the future.
