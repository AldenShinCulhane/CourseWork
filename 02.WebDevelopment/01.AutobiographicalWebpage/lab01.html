                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Alden Shin-Culhane and I'm a 21-year-old student enrolled
                    in the Computer Science Co-op program at Toronto Metropolitan University.
                    I was born in Toronto, Ontario and I grew up in Richmond Hill. After completing
                    high school, I moved to downtown Toronto for university.

                <h2>Some Fun Facts</h2>
                <p>
                    I was lucky to be a part of the Toronto Metropolitan Valorant team for two years,
                    during my 1st and 3rd year of university. This experience allowed me to form new
                    friendships, which was particularly important to me during my 1st year when classes
                    were online due to Covid-19. It also let me scratch my competitive itch, as I played
                    competitive sports for almost 10 years up until the last year of high school and really
                    enjoy competing.

                <h2>My Journey Throughout Co-op</h2>
                <p>
                    Participating in the Co-op program at Toronto Metropolitan University has been invaluable
                    to me. Over a total of 12 months so far, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work in two different
                    workplaces, gaining experience in both frontend and backend development. This has helped me
                    understand my preferences and expectations for the future, I feel like I have a good idea of
                    what to look for when applying for jobs now.

                    <p>
                        I have enjoyed my journey working in Computer Science so far, I especially cherish meeting
                        talented people that I can learn from and grow beside. The exposure to real-world projects,
                        deadlines and workplace environments in general has strengthened my coding skills and
                        made me a much more disciplined person all around.
