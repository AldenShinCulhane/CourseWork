It all begins with The Chosen One. 
His mother and father died when he was at a very young age and he was taken in by those that lived in "The Village", the place he grew up in.
What The Chosen One was never told about, was how his parents truly died. 
That all changed when The Village was forced into lockdown because of what was happening in "The Cave of Despair". 
The Cave of Despair was showing signs of life for the first time in over 25 years. 
The Chosen One rushed out into the panicking village to seek advice and guidance from the village's wise librarian. 
However when he reaches her, he gets much more than what he bargained for.
She tells him the truth about his parents. 
They fought for "The Resistance", a group of soldiers and heros that fought against the worst enemies known to man.
These enemies lived in the most dangerous place on earth, The Cave of Despair. 
After countless hard fought battles and inhuman challenges they had to conquer, they were able to defeat the enemies. 
However, it was ultimately at the cost of their own lives.
They were the ones to save the village, but they had to sacrafice themselves in the process.
They are no longer here, The Chosen One is the only living offspring of anyone who was in The Resistance.
25 years later and the enemies that murdered his parents have returned to the Cave of Despair.
They've come back even stronger and have set up even more near-impossible challenges that must be faced. 
If The Chosen One doesn't stop them, no one will.
He has been chosen for a reason, that reason has now come. 
Will he prevail and overcome the challenges that lay before him? 
Or will he fall in defeat? 
Play now, and you will decide his true fate.
