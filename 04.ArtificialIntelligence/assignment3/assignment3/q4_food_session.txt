%%%%% SECTION: foodDescription
%%%%% Put a brief description of your program below
% This program is designed to solve a meal planning problem for John over a week. It infers the meal
% and drink selections for each day from Monday to Friday based on a set of constraints. The solve
% predicate takes the meals and drinks for each day as variables, applies the constraints to these
% and finds a valid assignment for each variable that satisfies all the constraints. The solve_and_print
% predicate calls solve and then prints out the resulting meal plan in a readable format.

%%%%% SECTION: foodSession
%%%%% Put your session for the network problem below

% ?- solve(M1, M2, D1, M3, M4, D2, M5, M6, D3, M7, M8, D4, M9, M10, D5).
% M1 = sour_soup
% M2 = chow_mein
% D1 = milk
% M3 = chow_mein
% M4 = peking_duck
% D2 = coffee
% M5 = peking_duck
% M6 = egg_roll
% D3 = tea
% M7 = fried_rice
% M8 = chow_mein
% D4 = water
% M9 = egg_roll
% M10 = egg_roll
% D5 = juice

% ?- Start is cputime, solve_and_print, End is cputime, Time is End - Start.
% Start = 11.593
% End = 11.593
% Time = 0.0
% Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)

% Solution:
% Monday's first course meal is sour_soup
% Monday's second course meal is chow_mein
% Monday's drink is milk
% Tuesday's first course meal is chow_mein
% Tuesday's second course meal is peking_duck
% Tuesday's drink is coffee
% Wednesday's first course meal is peking_duck
% Wednesday's second course meal is egg_roll
% Wednesday's drink is tea
% Thursday's first course meal is fried_rice
% Thursday's second course meal is chow_mein
% Thursday's drink is water
% Friday's first course meal is egg_roll
% Friday's second course meal is egg_roll
% Friday's drink is juice
